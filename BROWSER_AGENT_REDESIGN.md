# BrowserAgent System Redesign

## Overview

This document outlines the complete redesign of the agent system to introduce a standalone **BrowserAgent** that is completely decoupled from the existing Decision agent. The BrowserAgent operates autonomously for all web-related tasks, taking instructions directly from Perception and executing multi-step browser automation without involving the Decision agent.

## 🎯 Objectives Achieved

✅ **Standalone BrowserAgent**: Created a completely independent BrowserAgent that operates without Decision agent involvement  
✅ **Multi-step Behavior**: BrowserAgent can handle complex, multi-turn browser automation tasks  
✅ **Form Interaction**: Advanced form detection, filling, and submission capabilities  
✅ **Autonomous Operation**: Self-contained behavior using browserMCP and mcp_servers tools  
✅ **Clean Separation**: No "Decision" references in browser-related pipeline  
✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite with form interaction and decoupling tests  

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### Before (Original System)
```
User Input → Perception → Decision → Action → Loop
```

### After (Redesigned System)
```
User Input → Perception → [BrowserAgent | Decision] → Action → Loop
```

**Key Changes:**
- Perception now routes browser tasks directly to BrowserAgent
- Decision agent is bypassed for all web-related tasks
- BrowserAgent operates independently with its own multi-step loop
- Clean separation of concerns between browser and non-browser tasks

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### BrowserAgent Class Features

```python
class BrowserAgent:
    """
    Standalone BrowserAgent for multi-step browser automation tasks.
    Takes a single instruction and operates autonomously across multiple steps.
    Completely decoupled from the Decision agent.
    """
```

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Multi-step Execution**: Internal loop with up to 15 steps
- **Form Interaction**: Advanced form detection and filling
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic with configurable limits
- **State Management**: Browser state tracking and persistence
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless integration with MCP tools
- **Autonomous Operation**: No dependency on Decision agent

### Form Interaction Functionality

```python
async def _handle_form_interaction(self, form_data: Dict[str, str], execution_state: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Handle complex form interactions with retry logic.
    """
```

**Features:**
- Automatic form field detection
- Smart field mapping by name/type
- Submit button identification
- Comprehensive error handling
- Step-by-step execution tracking

### Perception Routing Logic

The perception system now uses a **priority-based routing approach**:

1. **FIRST PRIORITY**: `route = "browser"` for web-related tasks
2. **SECOND PRIORITY**: `route = "summarize"` for completed tasks
3. **LAST PRIORITY**: `route = "decision"` for non-browser tasks

**Browser Detection Keywords:**
- Web navigation: "Go to", "Visit", "Navigate to", "Open"
- Form interactions: "Fill out", "Submit", "Click", "Enter"
- Web scraping: "Extract", "Get", "Find", "Search on website"
- URLs mentioned: Any web addresses or domain names
- Browser actions: "Take screenshot", "Save page", "Download"

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**

   - Submit button identification
   - Multi-field form filling
   - Error handling and retry logic

3. **Integration Tests**

   - Multi-step navigation workflows
   - End-to-end browser automation
   - Session management and state persistence

4. **Decoupling Tests**

# BrowserAgent executes: open_tab → done
```

### Example 2: Form Filling
```python
# User Input: "Go to https://example.com/contact and fill the form"
# Perception routes to BrowserAgent
# BrowserAgent executes: 
#   1. open_tab (navigate to page)
#   2. get_interactive_elements (find form fields)
#   3. input_text (fill name field)
#   4. input_text (fill email field)
#   5. click_element_by_index (submit form)
#   6. done (mark complete)
```

### Example 3: Content Extraction
